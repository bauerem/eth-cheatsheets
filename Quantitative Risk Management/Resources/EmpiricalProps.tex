\section*{Empirical Properties of Financial Data}
\subsection*{Stylized facts of financial return series}
\textbf{Scope/def:} Stylized facts often apply to daily log-returns (also to intra-daily, weekly, monthly). Tick-by-tick (high-frequency) data have their own stylized facts (not discussed here) and annual returns (low-frequency) data are more difficult (data sparsity; non-stationarity)

\textbf{Discrete-time risk-factor changes:} $X_t=Z_t-Z_{t-1}$, e.g. $Z_t=\log S_t$, in which case $X_t=\log(S_t/S_{t-1})\approx S_t/S_{t-1}-1=(S_t-S_{t-1})/S_{t-1}$; the former called (log-)return, latter (classical) return.

\subsection*{Longer time-interval return series}
\textbf{Setting:} daily$\rightarrow$weekly$\rightarrow$monthly$\rightarrow$quarterly$\rightarrow$yearly

\textbf{Non-overlapping $h$-period log-return at $t\in\{h,2h,\dots,nh\}$:}

$X_t^{(h)}=\log(\frac{S_t}{S_{t-h}})=\log(\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}\frac{S_{t-1}}{S_{t-2}}\cdots\frac{S_{t-h+1}}{S_{t-h}})=\sum^{h-1}_{i=0}X_{t-i}$

\begin{itemize}
    \item As $h\rightarrow \infty$ CLT effects take place (less heavy-tailed, less empirical serial correlation)
    \item As $h\rightarrow \infty$ less data is available
    \item Possible remedy: Consider overlapping returns
    $\{X^{(h)}_t:t\in \{h, h+k, \dots,h+nk\}\} \text{ for } 1\leq k <h$;
    More data but serially dependent
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Stylized facts: univariate return series}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(U\arabic*),itemsep=5pt,leftmargin=1cm]
    \item Return series not iid but little serial correlation
    \item Absolute or squared returns series show profound serial correlation
    \item Conditional expected returns are close to zero
    \item Volatility (conditional standard deviation) appears to vary over time
    \item Extreme returns appear in clusters
    \item Return series are leptokurtic or heavy-tailed (power-like tail)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Multivariate return series}
Similar to U1, $X_t$ and $Y_t$ show little correlation for two asset returns $(X_t)_t$ and $(Y_t)_t$.

Contemporaneous dependence

\subsection*{Stylized f.s: multivariate return series}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(M\arabic*),itemsep=5pt,leftmargin=1cm]
    \item Multivariate return series show little evidence of cross-correlation, except for contemporaneous returns (i.e. at the same $t$)
    \item Multivariate series of absolute returns show profound cross-correlation
    \item Correlations between contemporaneous returns vary over time
    \item Extreme returns in one series often coincide with extreme returns in several other series (e.g. tail dependence)
\end{enumerate}

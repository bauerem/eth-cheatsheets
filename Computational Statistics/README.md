# Computational Statistics Summary
This summary was written based on the lecture Computational Statistics at ETH ZÃ¼rich for the exam. It is mainly based on my handwritten lecture notes, the R-codes and exercises in the course. 
Small parts were done with the help of [Amray Schwabe](https://github.com/amrayschwabe/CompstatSummary).

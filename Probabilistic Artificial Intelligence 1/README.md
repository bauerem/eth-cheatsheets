# Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence

Semester: Fall semester 2020

Lecturer: Prof. Andreas Krause

## Summary

This course introduces core modeling techniques and algorithms from machine learning, optimization and control for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty, and study applications in areas such as robotics and the Internet.

How can we build systems that perform well in uncertain environments and unforeseen situations? How can we develop systems that exhibit "intelligent" behavior, without prescribing explicit rules? How can we build systems that learn from experience in order to improve their performance? We will study core modeling techniques and algorithms from statistics, optimization, planning, and control and study applications in areas such as sensor networks, robotics, and the Internet. The course is designed for graduate students.

Topics covered:
* Probability
* Probabilistic inference (variational inference, MCMC)
* Bayesian learning (Gaussian processes, Bayesian deep learning)
* Probabilistic planning (MDPs, POMPDPs)
* Multi-armed bandits and Bayesian optimization
* Reinforcement learning
